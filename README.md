# CloudSponge Examples
This is a public library of fully functional examples of the CloudSponge widget. You can deploy any of these html files into your `localhost` environment to start tinkering around with the product.

Hosting this directory is straightforward if you have python installed on your system:

* open a terminal
* cd to this directory
* run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5000`
* open [localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) in a browser

## basic.html
The simplest way to integrate the CloudSponge widget is to add an anchor tag with the <code>cloudsponge-launch</code> class somewhere on your page. Visit [localhost:5000/basic](http://localhost:5000/basic.html) now.

## deep-links.html
You can skip the main menu and let your users go straight to the contact source that they want by adding these deep links to your page. Visit [localhost:5000/deep-links](http://localhost:5000/deep-links.html) now.

Most people replace these text links with graphics. You can <a href="http://www.cloudsponge.com/img/developer/icon-set.zip">download some icons here</a> if you don't have your own set.
