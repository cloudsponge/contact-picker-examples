# CloudSponge Examples
This is a public library of fully functional examples of the CloudSponge widget. You can deploy any of these html files into your `localhost` environment to start tinkering around with the product.

Hosting this directory is straightforward if you have python installed on your system:

* open a terminal
* cd to this directory
* run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5000`
* open [localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) in a browser

## Basic Installation

The simplest way to integrate the CloudSponge widget is to add an anchor tag with the <code>cloudsponge-launch</code> class somewhere on your page.

* [Run /hello-world.html](/hello-world.html)
* [Run /basic.html](/basic.html)
* [Documentation](https://www.cloudsponge.com/developer/contact-picker/basic-installation/)

## Deep Links

You can skip the main menu and let your users go straight to the contact source that they want by adding these deep links to your page.

* [Run /deep-links.html](/deep-links.html)
* [Documentation](https://www.cloudsponge.com/developer/contact-picker/linking-options/deep-links/)

Most people replace these text links with graphics. You can [download some icons here](https://www.iconfinder.com/cloudsponge) if you don't have your own set.
