<!--
  Any widget integration must do three things:
    1) include the widget script,
    2) provide a way for the end user to launch the widget and,
    3) do something with the user's contacts.
  This basic integration does all.
 -->

<!-- 
  Include the script anywhere on your page, usually in the head
   (don't forget to replace `localhost-only` with your CloudSponge key)
  -->
<script src="https://api.cloudsponge.com/widget/localhost-only.js"></script>

<!-- 
  #2 provide a way for the end user to launch the widget:
  Any link with a class="cloudsponge-launch" will start the import process.
-->
<a class="cloudsponge-launch">Add from Address Book</a>

<!-- 
  #3 do something with the user's contacts:
  This textarea will be populated with the contacts returned by CloudSponge. 
-->
<textarea class="cloudsponge-contacts"></textarea>
